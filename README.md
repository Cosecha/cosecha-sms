# Cosecha SMS Web App

This is a 'simple' exercise for me to learn Node.js, React.js, and using the Twilio API.

The goal is to create Node.js webapp with the following user stories:

1. User can send an SMS to one person at a time to send them info on Cosecha.
2. User can choose certain resources to send.

That's good for now.

Having a hard time wrapping my head around redux. May need to go back after studying this more.
